# Deep-Learning

What Is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is an artificial intelligence function that imitates the workings 
of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making.
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence (AI) that has networks
capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as deep
neural learning or deep neural network.


How Deep Learning Works
Deep learning has evolved hand-in-hand with the digital era, which has brought about an explosion of data 
in all forms and from every region of the world. This data, known simply as big data, is drawn from sources
like social media, internet search engines, e-commerce platforms, and online cinemas, among others. 
This enormous amount of data is readily accessible and can be shared through fintech applications like cloud computing.

Deep Learning Versus Machine Learning

One of the most common AI techniques used for processing big data is machine learning, a self-adaptive algorithm 
that gets increasingly better analysis and patterns with experience or with newly added data.
